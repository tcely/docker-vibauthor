			  live-install-allowed and live-removal-allowed are false.
			  OPTIONAL: maintenance mode can be fine-tuned to be on or off for
			  new installs of a VIB vs upgrades or removals.  To do this,
			  specify one of the following attributes:
			    * on-install="false"/"true"
				 * on-remove="false"/"true"
			  An upgrade is considered a remove and a install.
			  If no attributes are specified, but instead a true/false value
			  as per the example below, it is the same as setting all attributes
			  to true/false.
